====================

**Note:** Yahoo now have a ["Get My Data" tool](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/getmydata)
available, which may provide an alternative to this tool, although the content it provides is not
known at the time of writing.

This tool archives a Yahoo group using the non-public API used by the Yahoo Groups website UI.

Features:
* Saves full email content
* Downloads attachments as separate files
* Fetch all files
* Fetch all photos
* Fetch all database tables
* Fetch all links
* Fetch all events in the calendar
* Fetch all polls

Requirements:
* Python 2.7 or 3+

Usage:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
./yahoo.py -ct '<T_cookie>' -cy '<Y_cookie>' '<groupid>'
```

You will need to get the `T` and `Y` cookie values from an authenticated
browser session.

The cookies should look like this, where `someLongText` and `someShortText` are arbitrary strings:
- T: `z=someLongText&a=someLongText&sk=someLongText&ks=someLongText&kt=someLongText&ku=someLongText&d=someLongText&af=someLongText`
- Y: `v=1&n=someLongText&l=someShortText=someShortText&r=hp&intl=us`

In Google Chrome these steps are required:
1. Go to [Yahoo Groups](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo).
2. Click the â“˜ (cicled letter i) in the address bar.
3. Click "Cookies".
4. On the Allowed tab select "Yahoo.com" followed by "Cookies" in the tree listing.
5. Select the T cookie and copy the Content field in place of `<T_cookie>` in the above command line.
6. Select the Y cookie and copy the Content field in place of `<Y_cookie>` in the above command line.

In Firefox:
1. Go to [Yahoo Groups](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo) (make sure you're signed in with your account).
2. Press Shift-F9 or select the menu Tools/Web Developer/Storage Inspector.
3. Double click on the T cookie's value and copy the content in place of `<T_cookie>` in the above command line.
4. Double click on the Y cookie's value and copy the content in place of `<Y_cookie>` in the above command line.

Note: the string you paste _must_ be surrounded by quotes.

Using the `--cookie-file` (or `-cf`) option allows you to specify a file in which the authentication cookies will be
loaded and saved in.

Files will be placed into the directory structure groupname/{email,files,photos,databases}
